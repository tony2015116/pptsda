# Description of your package

This will fill the description of your package.
Fill and run the content of this chunk, before anything else. 

Note: when you will use other flat templates, this part will be in a separate file. Do not be surprised!

# import_csv

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. 
You can add `1` to any `value` using function `import_csv()`.

    

  

```{r example-import_csv}
list_csv <- list.files("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/location301", pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE)
data <- import_csv(list_csv)
```

  


# adg_get

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. 
You can add `1` to any `value` using function `adg_get()`.



<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->


```{r examples-adg_get}
data <- rio::import("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/ppt_test_data.xlsx")
adg_res <- adg_get(data = data)
```

# dfi_get

    

  

```{r example-dfi_get}
data <- rio::import("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/ppt_test_data.xlsx")
adg_res <- adg_get(data = data)
dfi_get <- dfi_get(data = data, adg_about = adg_res)
```

  
  

# fcr_get

    

  

```{r example-fcr_get}
data <- rio::import("C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/ppt_test_data.xlsx")
fcr_res <- fcr_get(data = data, my_break = c(30, 115))
```

  
  
That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.
